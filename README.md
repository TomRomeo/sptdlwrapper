# Spotdl wrapper shell script

I created this wrapper script around spotdl because I wanted the songs
to be ordered into a folder of their respective artist

## Installation

Just clone the repo and use the script.

You might need to make it executeable with `chmod +x ./download.sh`

**You do also need to have spotdl installed**
